# Structure

(Trying to figure out the overall structure of the thesis.)

## Questions I need to figure out
- should I have acknowledgements, abstract, prerequisites etc. sections **before** the intro?

## Introduction
- introduce the main goal of the thesis
  - motivation for this goal

  - This should be reflected by the structure of the rest
