Diagrammatics for other types of monoidal categories, for example braided monoidal categories, some of which are mentioned in \cite{selinger-survey-of-graphical-monoidal-categories}.

We have defined diagrammatics for the smallest non-trivial case of $\fraksl_2$. We can attempt to extend it to other lie algebras.

The original goal for this thesis was to diagrammatically describe the categorification of the Lusztig--Vogan module in \cite{categorification-lusztig-vogan-module}. It is just one step beyond the diagrammatics for $\Tilt(\fraksl_2)$, where there may be a new generator where diagrams can interact with the wall.

Extending to include the details about all the representation theory.
