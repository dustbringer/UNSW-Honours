\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\thispagestyle{empty}

I give my deepest thanks to my supervisor, Anna Romanov, for putting me on this journey of diagrammatics, for teaching me all I know about Soergel bimodules, for organising my disorganisation and for sparking a love of examples; to Daniel Tubbenhauer for the countless hours spent answering my questions and for his enthusiasm and deep knowledge of diagrammatics and categories; and to Arnaud Brothier for all his profound insights into mathematical writing. Without them, this thesis would not be anything.

I also thank my friends and family for their continued encouragement and support.
