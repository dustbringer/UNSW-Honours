For a category $\mcal{C}$ we write $\op{ob}(\mcal{C})$ for the collection of objects, $\op{mor}(\mcal{C})$ for the collection of all morphisms, and for any pair of objects $A,B$ we write $\Hom(A,B)$ for the collection of morphisms from $A$ to $B$. The collection of endomorphisms of an object $A$ is written $\End(A) \coloneqq \Hom(A,A)$. Note that our focus of study are particular types of categories, not categories in the abstract sense, so we will assume that all categories we encounter are locally small, that is for any objects $A$ and $B$, $\Hom(A,B)$ is a set.
