\chapter{Background}

For a category $\mcal{C}$ we write $\op{ob}(\mcal{C})$ for the collection of objects, $\op{mor}(\mcal{C})$ for the collection of all morphisms, and for any pair of objects $A,B$ we write $\Hom(A,B)$ for the collection of morphisms from $A$ to $B$. The collection of endomorphisms of an object $A$ is written $\End(A) \coloneqq \Hom(A,A)$. Note that our focus of study are particular types of categories, not categories in the abstract, so we may assume that all categories we encounter are locally small.
