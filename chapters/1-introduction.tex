\chapter{Introduction}

Visual interpretations of functions simplify calculations and often provides insights into the mathematical objects they encode. \red{More detail about what this is} This general philosophy takes form in various settings. A simple example are string diagrams for finite permutations. A permutation can be drawn as strings between two copies of a set determining how the objects are permuted. Compositions of these permutations is the operation of joining corresponding strings start to end in order to create a larger string diagram representing their product. 

A more significant example are \textit{planar algebras} in the study of von Neumann algebras, particularly for subfactors, first introduced by Jones in 1999, \cite{jones-planar-algebra}. These are algebras where operations are indexed by planar diagrams made up of disks, and which combine in planar ways. The development of planar algebras really kick-started study of subfactors, and there have been a wide range of applications for this technology. \red{Add more here}
% THIS WAS ALL BEFORE PLANAR ALGEBRAS: A notable one is in knot theory, where Jones came across an important knot invariant we now know as the Jones polynomial. There are a wide range of implications in the study of for example statistical mechanics, combinatorial group theory, quantum groups, particle physics and untangling of DNA in biology.
